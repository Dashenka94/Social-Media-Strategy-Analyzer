In this project, I analyze Instagram and Facebook posts to identify the best social media strategy for Reels. Using sentiment analysis, I compare the effectiveness of each platform. I also examine post engagement across different hours and product categories, compare the popularity of Reels versus carousels at various times, and track how post sentiments change throughout the day and across platforms for different product categories.
